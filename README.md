# AI-Powered-Personalized-Nutrition-Recommendation-System

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered personalized nutrition recommendation system. The system will analyze users' dietary habits, health data, and preferences to provide tailored nutritional advice. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, we aim to help users make healthier food choices and achieve their dietary goals.

### Objectives
  1. Data Collection: Gather dietary, health, and preference data from users.
  2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data.
  3. Model Development: Develop a machine learning model to provide personalized nutrition recommendations.
  4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and refine it.
  5. Deployment: Deploy the model via a web or mobile application.
  6. User Interface: Develop an intuitive user interface for users to interact with the system.

### Tools and Technologies
###### Programming Language: Python
###### Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK/Spacy, Flask/Django, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React or similar frontend framework
###### Database: SQLite/MySQL for storing user data
###### Deployment: Flask/Django for creating a web API, Docker for containerization

#### Data Collection
Data will be collected from users through a questionnaire that captures their dietary habits, health metrics (e.g., weight, height, age, allergies), and preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
